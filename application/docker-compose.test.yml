# TODO: Right now, integration tests will be really slow. fix this when there's more tests
# right now, I'm using a single database and basically running it with --runInBand, so it's sequential instead of running in parallel
# this is because every test I'm basically clearing the data and then putting data in, so I have to make sure clearData does not
# cause any locking and breaks every single test
# one way I can introduce some form of parallelism in the future (probs not scalable) is just by adding more dbs and choosing specific tests to run
# TODO: I also have to fix the docker container because sometimes when I try to connect to the port, it's not ready yet (wait-for library or something)
