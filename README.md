## About The Project
<!-- TODO: INSERT SCREENSHOT OF PROJECT -->
{ADD SCREENSHOT OF MAIN FEATURES OF PROJECT}

When I worked in the eCommerce space selling anime merchandise wholesale and retail, I had some key observations:
<ol>
  <li>Product performance on one online store or marketplace didn't necessarily translate to sales on another platform.</li>
  <li>Even high-quality products with a clear market struggled to gain sales traction, ending up as unsold inventory.</li>
  <li>Successful products created a positive feedback loop:
    <ul>
      <li>Wholesale customers were more willing to purchase and stock items with proven sales records.</li>
      <li>Increased visibility of successful products generally led to more purchases and brand recognition and attracted new retail and wholesale customers.</li>
      <li>Strong sales of one product often boosted sales of complementary products</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

These observations led me to a crucial question: could I create a risk-free method for wholesale customers to test out manufacturers' promising but underperforming products, and potentially trigger the positive feedback loop of successful products? That was my motivation for building Synqsell, a Shopify app that allows cross-store product imports between suppliers and retailers, and automatic synchronization of prices, orders, and payments.
