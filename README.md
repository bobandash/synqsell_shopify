## About The Project

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2317aef8-2a5b-4fdd-95ad-fbe742d0d974)

When I worked in the eCommerce space selling anime merchandise, I had some key observations:

<ol>
  <li>Product performance on one online store or marketplace didn't necessarily translate to sales on another platform.</li>
  <li>Even high-quality products with a clear market struggled to gain sales traction, ending up as unsold inventory.</li>
  <li>Successful products created a positive feedback loop:
    <ul>
      <li>Wholesale customers were more willing to purchase and stock items with proven sales records.</li>
      <li>Increased visibility of successful products generally led to more purchases and brand recognition and attracted new retail and wholesale customers.</li>
      <li>Strong sales of one product often boosted sales of complementary products</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

These observations led me to a crucial question: could I create a risk-free method for wholesale customers to test out manufacturers' promising but underperforming products, and potentially trigger the positive feedback loop of successful products? That was my motivation for building Synqsell, a Shopify app that allows cross-store product imports between suppliers and retailers, and automatic synchronization of prices, orders, and payments.

### Deployment

Status: Final stages. Preparing for submission on Shopify's App Store.

### Roadmap

10/13/2024
Here are a list of features that are still needed before the application can be submitted for review

- (DONE) - Subscribe to Shopify's Privacy Webhook Topics
- (DONE) - Add sales generated section for price list index table
- (DONE) - Use Stripe's webhook topics to ensure that the database is synced properly to stripe statuses
- (DONE) Handle the app/uninstalled webhook for suppliers and retailers
- (DONE) Create all relevant assets and bullet points for the Shopify app store
- (DONE) Add ALB and EC2 to deploy web/application server
- Create a CD Pipeline for adding the new application code to the ecr
- One final check to verify all API endpoints, webhooks, and application code work as intended
- Update readme: https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/launch/protected-customer-data, https://partners.shopify.com/3776451/apps/{app_number}/customer_data, instructions to update shopify.app.toml w/ eventbridge url and running shopify app deploy --config shopify.app.toml

Here are the nice to have features / should be done after deployment:

- Decide the retry strategy to adopt when interacting with Shopify's external API (thinking about retry mechanism w/ exponential backoff, and caching for things like product pages, but seeing if there are other approaches before implement), don't have to worry too much about this until relative scale because we have 2k tokens, leaky bucket algo.
- (Has to be done immediately after deployment): There's no webhook Stripe calls that makes sure the payment method is not expired / is still valid, I need to set up a Cron job once a month that checks each payment method and emails the users if they need to update their payment method
- Add skeleton loading pages to all other pages in the application (the homepage has a skeleton loading page)
- Currency conversion for retailers and suppliers in different countries
- Handle refunds for when a supplier or retailer refunds an order
- If a supplier changes tracking details after 7 days, it should not affect the retailer's price list
- Refactor the Lambda functions to use layers for shared functions (DRY principle)
- Talk to users: need to see whether or not suppliers would want methods of increasing sales that the retailers can use (e.g. injecting Shopify liquid to theme to do a countdown for product launches)
- Refactor basic model queries and mutations (most of it was written when I initially started the project, so a lot needs to be refactored)
- Change error handling strategy (I don't believe that printing out the function name in the log files is worth it to be honest; it has so much room for error)

### Features At A Glance

Because this application requires cloud resources, seeing the application locally will require money. So, I created a [notion writeup with images of SynqSell's main features](https://aback-thistle-ade.notion.site/Features-At-A-Glance-8be5cba5a5254a67bb59845c5b1c738a).

### Installation

For AWS:

1. Change the working directory to aws
   ```sh
   cd aws
   ```
2. Navigate to the template.yaml file and you may need to change the BucketName property for the AWS::S3::Bucket resource (bucket names must be unique, and I am currently using synqsell-image-hosting for the dev environment)
3. Build the template.yaml file
   ```sh
   sam build
   ```
4. Deploy your cloud resources onto your AWS account with parameters relevant to the resources you created in the prerequisites step
   ```sh
   sam deploy --parameter-overrides BastionHostKeyName=<ParameterValue1> StripeSecretsManagerARN=<ParameterValue2> EventBusArn=<ParameterValue3> MyCidrIP=<ParameterValue4>
   ```
   - `<BastionHostKeyName>`, `<StripeSecretsManagerARN>`, `<EventBusArn>` - Generated in Prerequisites
   - `<MyCidrIP>` - Your [public IP address](https://www.whatismyip.com/) with /32 appended at the end of your public IP
5. Important values will be outputted in the terminal after the changeset is deployed. Please record these values, which are important in setting up the local application
6. Navigate to AWS API Gateway and activate the deployment for dev.

For the Shopify Application:

1. Open your terminal as an administrator
2. Create a tunnel from your local database to RDS via the bastion host created:
   ```sh
   ssh -i <BASTION_KEY.PEM> -NL 8886:<DB_ENDPOINT_ADDRESS>:5432 ec2-user@<BASTION_HOST_IP> -v
   ```
   - `<BASTION_KEY.PEM>` - The file path of the private key file you generated and downloaded in Prerequisites
   - `<DB_ENDPOINT_ADDRESS>`, `<BASTION_HOST_IP>` - Found in the CloudFormation/SAM outputs after deployment.
3. Open another terminal instance in your IDE
4. Change the working directory to the application
   ```sh
   cd application
   ```
5. Obtain your database password (the "password" field from this output)
   ```sh
    aws secretsmanager get-secret-value --secret-id <DB_SECRETS_ARN> --query 'SecretString' --output text
   ```
   - `<DB_SECRETS_ARN>` - Found in the CloudFormation/SAM outputs after deployment.
6. Create a .env file inside the working directory and copy and paste the values in the .sample.env
   - `<DATABASE_URL>` - postgresql://postgres:<DB_PASSWORD>@localhost:8886/postgres, with the DB_PASSWORD being the password you obtained in step 5
   - `<AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>` and `<AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>` - Generated and stored in Prerequisites
   - `<STRIPE_SECRET_API_KEY>` and `<REACT_APP_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY>` - Generated and stored in Prerequisites
   - `<ADMIN_SESSION_ID>` - Leave blank. You will have to look in the database after the first user has been created and get the session id
   - Default Values - `<NODE_ENV>`: development
   - Rest - If not specified explicitly, these values are found in the CloudFormation/SAM outputs after deployment.
7. Run the following command to start the application.
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
8. Open the preview URL that was generated in the terminal. Your database migrations should start running.
9. Open pgAdmin4 or software of your choice in which you can access the Session Table data
   - `<Host name>` - localhost
   - `<Port>` - 8886
   - `<Username>` - postgres
   - `<Password>` - Retrieved in step 5
10. Modify the `ADMIN_SESSION_ID` in the .env file to be the id generated in the session table
11. Run the following command:
    ```sh
    npx prisma db seed
    ```
12. Refresh your preview, and your Shopify account should become an admin of the application and the checklist tables should be loaded.
13. Add more stores to the application and start importing products from other stores!

### Uninstallation

When you are done with the local development, navigate to AWS CloudFormation on AWS and delete the stack, so you are not billed for the resources in use.

## Architecture

This is the current architecture of Synqsell.
<br />
<br />
Note: the architecture currently has many single points of failure. This is intentional because of the application's lack of users; If the application scales with more users, the architecture should continue to evolve alongside the growth.
<br />

## Technical Approach and Obstacles

This section delves into the rationale behind key technical decisions when working on this project and highlights the challenges I encountered during the project's development.
<br />
<br />
Regarding automated testing, I purposely chose not to write many automated tests. This was for a few reasons:

<ul>
  <li><strong>Development Team Size:</strong> As the sole developer on this project, the risk of unexpected breaking changes is minimized. This allows for a more agile development process without the immediate need for extensive test coverage.</li>
  <li><strong>Anticipated Future Changes:</strong> Given the early nature of this SaaS application, I expect significant changes and modifications to the SaaS. Investing a lot of time in automated tests could just lead to inefficient use of development resources.</li>
  <li><strong>Focus on MVP and User Feedback:</strong> My goal was to create an MVP or POC to gather real-world feedback as soon as possible. In doing so, the future development direction and user needs could be identified more rapidly.</li>
</ul>
<br />
However, I wanted to also balance this project as a learning opportunity, to experiment and deepen my knowledge of technologies such as:

### Remix.run

Before this project, I had never used a full-stack web framework before. While I had used Next.js, I never used the full-stack web capabilities of Next.js, instead, I relied on separate backend services for API calls. In Remix.run, I originally developed under the assumption that actions were the equivalent of POST, DELETE, PATCH API in traditional backends, returning JSON data to update the UI.
<br />
<br />
However, as I delved deeper into the project and Remix's documentation, I realized this approach wasn't optimal, and that actions automatically trigger the route's loader (the GET request to server-side render the page again). This meant I could simplify my code and allow my UI to automatically update based on the refreshed loader data whenever my route calls an action. This revelation sparked a paradigm shift in my thinking: I understood at a higher level the trade-offs between tightly coupling your backend and frontend into a full-stack framework and keeping a loosely coupled backend and frontend. While you sacrifice the ability to make your backend API consumable by multiple frontend, it significantly streamlines the development for a single frontend consumer with UI rendering depending on actions.
<br />
<br />
As a side note, for a platform like Shopify that's encouraging most of their app developers to switch to embedded apps (apps running within an iFrame on Shopify, creating a seamless experience for merchants), setting the default development experience as a full-stack framework like Remix both makes it easier for Shopify developers to create an app and more more challenging to migrate to a non-embedded app in the future. This highlights an important consideration in the future for choosing a development approach for platform-specific applications.

### AWS

Despite this project's early stage, I decided to learn and implement scalable cloud solutions using AWS. While I recently obtained the AWS Certified Cloud Practioner certification, I recognized that the certificate primarily involved memorizing AWS microservices rather than gaining practical experience.

In this project, I wanted to move beyond theoretical knowledge and acquire hands-on experience using AWS microservices and IaC tools like CloudFormation/AWS SAM. When developing AWS Lambda functions, I initially struggled with manually testing if the functions were properly receiving Shopify's webhooks and updating the database. Despite my general approach of minimizing automated tests, I initially resorted to writing integration tests to verify function calls, aiming to maximize development efficiency.
<br />
<br />
However, I later learned about AWS SAM Accelerate and log watch features. These tools allowed me to sync Lambda function code with my AWS infrastructure in real-time, eliminating the need for frequent deployments or extensive integration testing. This hands-on approach, while challenging, provided invaluable insights into cloud-based application development and significantly enhanced my practical skills with AWS services.
<br />
<br />
These are a few problems that I faced when developing this app. I learned a tremendous amount developing this project, and I'm excited to further my knowledge of development, cloud computing, system design, and other concepts.

## Contributing

This GitHub repo will host the public version of the MVP/PoC. There will be a separate, private repo with new features/changes. If you would like to contribute to the live application, please reach out to me at brucehsu1126@gmail.com. I would love to work with other developers to build a better platform that helps both manufacturers and retailers sell more products.
